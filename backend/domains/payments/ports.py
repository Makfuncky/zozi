"""payments domain - sanctioned cross-domain READ surface (ports).

Per NEW_STRUCTURE.md Law 3, cross-domain *reads* may ONLY happen through a
publishing domain's ``ports.py``. Other domains import these functions instead
of importing ``domains.payments.models`` or ``domains.payments.services`` directly.

These are pure read helpers: no writes, no business decisions, no permission
checks (callers remain responsible for feature gating via ``rbac``).

# Cross-domain readers are registered here as the single sanctioned surface
# for other domains to read payments state. Add read-only helpers below.
